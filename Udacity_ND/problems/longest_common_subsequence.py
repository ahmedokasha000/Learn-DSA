# Longest Common SubsequenceÂ¶

# In text analysis, it is often useful to compare the similarity of two texts (imagine if you were trying to determine plagiarism between a source and answer text). In this notebook, we'll explore one measure of text similarity, the Longest Common Subsequence (LCS).

# The Longest Common Subsequence is the longest sequence of letters that are present in both the given two strings in the same relative order.

# Example - Consider the two input strings, str1 = 'ABCD' and str2 = 'AXBXDX'. The LCS will be 'ABD' with the length as 3 letters. It is because each of the letters 'A' , 'B', and 'D' are present in both the given two strings in the same relative order. Note that:

# An LCS need not necessarily be a contiguous substring.
# There can be more than one LCS present in the given two strings.
# There can be many more common subsequences present here, with smaller length. But, in this problem we are concerned with the longest common subsequence.
